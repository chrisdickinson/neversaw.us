about_me: |
  I'm a software engineer with $NYEARS years of experience. I've shipped software across
  a variety of contexts: from newsrooms and local radio stations to the biggest
  software package registry in the world and the open source project behind the most
  popular serverside JavaScript platform.

  I believe that a well-aligned, high-trust team with a clear vision can
  accomplish amazing things. I help build that environment wherever I work. I
  love to teach, to learn, and to work with teams to build tools and frameworks
  that reflect their technical values.

    title: Engineer
    duration:
      start: Jun 2022
      end: Apr 2023

      I worked with a small team to define & build a compute product,
      understand & implement security boundaries (including networking), and
      speed up shipping iterations. Got a crash course on networking. Built an
      on-line management system for Nomad using Rust. Additionally: built
      internal development environment tools to unblock multiple teams. These
      tools formed the basis for the CI system. Used multiple cloud providers
      during the course of this work: Hetzner, GCP, NetActuate, AWS, Azure,
      through a combination of in-house and external tools (e.g., Terraform,
      Pulumi.)

      I approached each task with a laser focus on automation in the aim of
      maximizing return on effort, while validating the results of my work with
      peers.

  - company: Eaze Solutions, LLC
    title: Principal Engineer
    duration:
      start: Apr 2018

      Replaced the deployment system at Eaze. This cut monthly infrastructure cost in
      half, took the average service deploy time down from one hour to two minutes, improved morale across
      teams by reducing contention on shared environments, and allowed us to scale
      the department by decoupling teams from one another.

      I endeavoured to ensure that, beyond being a technical improvement, the system
      would be adopted by engineering successfully: I validated the new deployment systems across
      teams, making sure to incorporate their feedback so that they could see
      their values reflected in the tool. Further, I made sure all engineers
      felt ownership over the tool by working with them to make changes to it.
      See ["Deploying at Eaze"][1] for more.

      Additionally, I built platform tools to ensure a base level of
      capabilities across our services, ensuring all teams had access to quality
      monitoring, logging, and observability. As teams began adopting TypeScript, I
      ported JavaScript internal tools for their use. 

      Finally, I worked to give the team porting our monolithic C# application
      tools to validate their changes. This involved coordinating a 30 person
      team in the construction of a series of high level integration tests
      across multiple areas of software engineering (mobile eng, website
      engineering, & backend engineering.) I gave a [well-received][2]
      presentation on the results to Honeycomb.

  - company: npm, Inc.
    title: Staff Engineer
    duration:
      start: Jul 2015
      end: Apr 2018
    description: |
      Kept the npm registry running as it scaled from 400 million to 9 billion
      downloads a week between 2015 and 2018.

      Worked primarily as a high level individual contributor, responsible for
      development on the ACL system, publish flow, static asset serving
      (package.json and tarball), billing system, and React-based website.
      Coordinated team efforts as a project manager and acted as an engineering
      manager as needed.

      I successfully shipped major migrations of the billing system, the content
      delivery network (To Cloudflare Edge Workers from Fastly VCL), the ACL system,
      the website, and the package publication flow. I assisted in infrastructure work,
      provisioning servers using Terraform and AWS and building deploy tooling in
      Node and Ansible. I participated in on-call rotation using Pagerduty and was
      relied upon to fix operational problems when both on- and off-call and was the primary
      responsible individual for multiple high-profile on-call incidents.

      Walmart representative on the open source io.js Technical Committee,
      Node.js Technical Committee, and the Node.js Technical Steering
      Committee, run through the Node Foundation. 

      Focused on optimizing JavaScript for the V8 engine, building partial evaluators
      for pre-TypeScript ecosystem static analysis, and the streams subsystem.

      Coordinated early efforts to
      add promises to core, added history support to the Node REPL, and helped
      define the initial charter system for working groups. Continued on in my
      role on the TSC until mid-2017.
